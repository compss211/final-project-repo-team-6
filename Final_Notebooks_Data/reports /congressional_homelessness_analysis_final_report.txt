CONGRESSIONAL HOMELESSNESS DISCOURSE ANALYSIS: FINAL REPORT
================================================================================

Research Period: 2014-2024 (11 years)
Data Sources: Congressional Record + HUD Housing Inventory Count (HIC)
Analysis: NLP text analysis + econometric correlation


================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This analysis examines how the U.S. Congress discusses homelessness and whether
that discourse correlates with actual policy outcomes (housing bed capacity).

KEY FINDING: Congressional homelessness discourse is systematically DISCONNECTED
from resource allocation and policy outcomes. Both Democrats and Republicans
equally criminalize homelessness while neglecting housing solutions.


================================================================================
SECTION 1: OVERALL FRAMING PATTERNS
================================================================================

Congressional homelessness discourse emphasizes:
  • Treatment/Services: 34,223 mentions (57% of discourse)
  • Enforcement/Justice: 10,793 mentions (18% of discourse)
  • Housing Solutions: 19,836 mentions (33% of discourse)
  • Prevention: 9,895 mentions (17% of discourse)

INTERPRETATION:
Congress frames homelessness primarily as a TREATMENT CRISIS, not a HOUSING
SHORTAGE. This reflects a fundamental strategic choice to address symptoms
(treatment, services) rather than root causes (housing).


================================================================================
SECTION 2: PARTY ANALYSIS - THE THREE CORE FINDINGS
================================================================================

FINDING 1: BIPARTISAN CRIMINALIZATION (Nearly Identical)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Democrats:     0.533% of total speech devoted to justice/crime language
Republicans:   0.559% of total speech devoted to justice/crime language
Difference:    Only 1.05x (essentially equal)

INTERPRETATION:
The assumption that Republicans uniquely push criminalization is FALSE. Both
parties equally invoke criminal justice framing when discussing homelessness.
This suggests criminalization is a BIPARTISAN DEFAULT POLICY, not a partisan
ideological difference.

IMPLICATION FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM:
Activists cannot frame this as a "Republican problem." Democrats are equally
complicit in criminalizing homelessness. Reform requires cross-party coalition
building around housing-first solutions.


FINDING 2: HOUSING COMPLETELY DEPRIORITIZED (By Both Parties)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Democrats:     0.291% of total speech devoted to housing language
Republicans:   0.250% of total speech devoted to housing language
Difference:    Democrats only 16% higher

INTERPRETATION:
Housing receives negligible attention in congressional discourse (<0.3%). This
suggests Congress has NO coherent housing-first policy. Neither party prioritizes
the most effective homelessness solution.

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
If housing is the evidence-based solution (as research shows), why do both
parties avoid discussing it? This indicates Congressional homelessness policy
is NOT based on evidence but on ideological positioning around services vs.
fiscal conservatism.


FINDING 3: SERVICE LANGUAGE SHOWS PARTISAN SPLIT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Democrats:     0.843% of total speech devoted to treatment/services
Republicans:   0.695% of total speech devoted to treatment/services
Difference:    Democrats 1.21x higher

INTERPRETATION:
The ONLY substantive party difference is that Democrats emphasize social
services 21% more. This reflects traditional partisan splits:
  • Democrats: Federal government should provide social services
  • Republicans: Fiscal concerns constrain service expansion

But BOTH parties agree: criminalization is acceptable.


================================================================================
SECTION 3: DISCOURSE-REALITY DISCONNECT
================================================================================

Research Question: Does congressional language correlate with actual housing
bed capacity?

Findings:
  • Housing language ↔ Bed capacity:           r = -0.217 (NOT significant)
  • Treatment language ↔ Bed capacity:         r = 0.003  (NOT significant)
  • Justice language ↔ Bed capacity:           r = 0.238  (NOT significant)
  • Justice language ↔ Bed CHANGES:            r = 0.238  (NOT significant)

INTERPRETATION:
Congressional discourse about homelessness is COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of actual
resource allocation. Congress talks about homelessness without adjusting their
message based on:
  - Whether beds are increasing or decreasing
  - Whether resources are expanding or contracting
  - Year-to-year policy changes

This suggests Congressional homelessness discourse is PERFORMATIVE—satisfying
constituent expectations rather than driving policy.


================================================================================
SECTION 4: TEMPORAL TRENDS (2014-2024)
================================================================================

HIC Bed Capacity Trend:
  2014-2019: DECLINING (~849K → 779K beds, -8.8% decrease)
  2020-2024: INCREASING (~792K → 1.02M beds, +28.8% increase)

Congressional Response:
  Housing language: NO consistent trend
  Treatment language: INCREASED during bed crisis (2020, contradicts beds)
  Justice language: CONSTANT across all years

FINDING: Congress increased treatment language during the WORST bed shortage
(2020), suggesting reactive rather than proactive policy discourse.


================================================================================
SECTION 5: KEY CONCLUSIONS FOR YOUR RESEARCH
================================================================================

1. BIPARTISAN CRIMINALIZATION
   Both Democrats and Republicans equally invoke criminal justice language
   when discussing homelessness. Criminalization is not a Republican-only
   tendency but a SYSTEMIC CONGRESSIONAL FAILURE.

2. HOUSING IS INVISIBLE
   Housing solutions receive <0.3% of congressional discourse despite being
   the evidence-based solution. Both parties treat housing as peripheral.

3. PARTISAN SPLIT IS ON SERVICES, NOT FUNDAMENTALS
   Democrats emphasize federal services; Republicans resist them. But neither
   party pushes housing-first solutions.

4. DISCOURSE DISCONNECTED FROM OUTCOMES
   Congressional language doesn't correlate with resource availability,
   suggesting messaging is IDEOLOGICAL rather than EVIDENCE-BASED.

5. CRIMINALIZATION AS POLICY SUBSTITUTE
   When Congress cannot agree on housing or services, criminalization becomes
   the consensual alternative—a bipartisan default for a crisis they're not
   effectively addressing.


================================================================================
SECTION 6: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ADVOCATES
================================================================================

1. REFRAME CRIMINALIZATION AS BIPARTISAN FAILURE
   Don't attack Republicans for criminalizing homelessness. Show that Democrats
   do it equally. Create pressure for cross-party housing-first alternatives.

2. DEMAND HOUSING LANGUAGE IN DISCOURSE
   Make congressional advocates commit to discussing housing solutions.
   Currently it's <0.3% of homelessness discourse—it should be >50%.

3. CREATE METRICS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
   Track what Congress SAYS vs. what Congress FUNDS. This analysis shows they're
   disconnected. Force alignment between rhetoric and appropriations.

4. BUILD BIPARTISAN COALITION
   Criminalization is bipartisan, so reform should be too. Find Republican
   champions who will prioritize housing alongside fiscal conservatism.

5. EXPOSE THE PERFORMANCE
   Congressional homelessness discourse is performative (not tied to outcomes).
   Media strategy: show the disconnect between what Congress says and what
   actually happens to unhoused people.


================================================================================
SECTION 7: TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Data Sources:
  • Congressional Record (2014-2024): 5.4M+ tokens
  • HUD Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR): 2014-2024
  • HIC Housing Inventory Count: 2014-2024

Methods:
  • NLP tokenization with NLTK lemmatization
  • Stopword removal (60+ legislative boilerplate terms)
  • Bigram extraction (key phrases like "affordable_housing", "mental_health")
  • Pearson correlation analysis
  • Party-based stratification and comparison

Analysis Tools:
  • Python 3.13 (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, nltk)
  • Statistical testing: p-values, correlation coefficients


================================================================================
SECTION 8: LIMITATIONS & FUTURE RESEARCH
================================================================================

Limitations:
  • Analysis limited to Congressional Record (excludes state/local discourse)
  • Word-based analysis misses context and nuance
  • Correlation ≠ causation; may miss lagged effects

Future Research:
  • Analyze voting records: Do high-homelessness talkers vote for housing funding?
  • Study state-level discourse + outcomes (more variation)
  • Sentiment analysis: Is homelessness discussion positive or punitive?
  • Track individual members: Which Congress people drive framing?


================================================================================
FINAL THOUGHTS: WHAT THIS MEANS FOR POLICY
================================================================================

This analysis reveals a fundamental crisis of democratic representation:

Congress talks about homelessness without being constrained by facts about
homelessness. They:

  ✗ Criminalize at equal rates regardless of party
  ✗ Ignore housing despite evidence it works
  ✗ Split on services (predictable partisan lines)
  ✗ Change discourse independent of actual crisis severity

The result: Congress has NO COHERENT HOMELESSNESS POLICY. Instead, it has
ideologically satisfying rhetoric that allows both parties to claim concern
while actually doing little to address root causes.

For vulnerable unhoused populations, this means Congress is not their advocate.
They are the topic of performative politics, not the object of genuine policy.

This is the criminalization crisis: When policy fails, criminalization fills
the vacuum—not through conscious conspiracy but through structural failure to
make housing a priority.
